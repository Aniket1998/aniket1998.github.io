## About Me

Hi! I'm a first year PhD student in the CS Theory Group at Stanford. My interests broadly lie at the intersection of probability and theoretical computer science. Less broadly, I like thinking about Markov Chains, the complexity of statistical inference, and algorithmic applications of Wasserstein Gradient Flows. 

Prior to grad school, I was a Pre-Doctoral Researcher at Google DeepMind. Even earlier,  I was a dazed and confused undergrad at Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, where I double majored in Electrical Engineering and Math.
