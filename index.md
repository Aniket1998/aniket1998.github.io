## About Me

I am a first year PhD student at Stanford CS. Prior to this, I was a Pre-Doctoral Researcher at Google DeepMind. Before that, I was a dazed and confused undergrad at Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, where I double majored in Electrical Engineering and Math.


##  Research

I'm broadly interested in the design and analysis of algorithms by applying ideas from probability and geometry. Specific interests include the analysis of Markov Chains, complexity of statistical inference, continuous optimization and Wasserstein Gradient Flows.
